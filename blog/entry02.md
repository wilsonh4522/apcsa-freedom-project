### Content
For my APCSA project I am creating an alarm that will not stop until you do a certain task. This week I decided that the **task will be some kind of simple math problem**. For example when the alarm rings you will have **to solve 44+68 so that the alarm can stop**. It has been about 2 months after wring blog 1 and I have continued to **tinker** with my tool. Since learning swift is new to me, I have been **watching vidoes** and **doing some lessons on swift playground**. Which teaches you about swift and how to use some of the components on swift. In that app it **taught me** about loops and how I could use it in swift. It gave me step by step lessons and they were similar to other coding langauge I learned like JavaScript. I am continuing to watch youtube vidoes about people making projects with swift like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2W9MPjrIbk). 

### EDP
In the Enginnering Design Process I am developing my app. I plan on making a **wireframe** of my website that way I have a better idea of what is looks like. I am also continuing on **learning how to use swift and gaining more expereince** on it so I can code my project. 

### Skills
The skills that I have so far learned is ***how to read and how to learn**. I am learnng more about my programing langauge. Therefore I need to read more about it in websites and documentations.
