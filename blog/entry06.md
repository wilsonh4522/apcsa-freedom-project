# Entry 6

### Context
In APCSA we are doing a year long project where we get to create anything I want. For my project I decided to make an alarm that will only stop until you solve a math problem. For this I used Swift to code the project. I have finished my MVP (Minimal Viable Product) which is that I created a functioning alarm that will alert the user for what time they want to be alerted. I have finished my beyond MVP which was to get the user's input from the alert. Now that I have completed both I had to present my project in the expo where judges and other students would walk around and see our project. After doing that I had to do a class presentation about my project.
