### Context
In APCSA we are doing a year long project where we get to create anything I want. For my project I decided to make an alarm that will only stop until you solve a math problem. For this I used Swift to code the project. I have finished my MVP (Minimal Viable Product) which is that I created a functioning alarm that will alert the user for what time they want to be alerted. I am now trying to make a pop up math problem where the users inputs answer and if it is correct the alert will stop. This is challenging because I will have to do a lot of research and learn; however I do have my MVP.

### Content
I wanted to get the users input when the alarm rings so I began to research how to get the user's input in general and I saw this [Swift Documentation link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/untextinputnotificationresponse) but I had to figure out how to code it. I figured out that I had to put it into a class in order for it to work.

### EDP
In the Engineering Design Process, I am creating the prototype of my feature which is to to get the input from the user. My next steps would be testing it and fixing any bugs.
