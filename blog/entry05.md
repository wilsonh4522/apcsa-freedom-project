# Entry 5

### Context
In APCSA we are doing a year long project where we get to create anything I want. For my project I decided to make an alarm that will only stop until you solve a math problem. For this I used Swift to code the project. I have finished my MVP (Minimal Viable Product) which is that I created a functioning alarm but the feature that I wants isnt there. I am now trying to make a pop up math problem where the users inputs answer and if it is correct the alert will stop. This is challenging to do but I have my MVP
