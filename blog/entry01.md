### Content
For my APCSA class we have a year long project in where we can create anything we want with any tool. For my project I will me **making an alarm clock that will not stop ringing until you do a task to stop it**. That way you are able to wakeup and feel awake. I will be making this project with Swift, a **C++ programing language**. I have so far tinkered with Swift by downloading the app [Swift Playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/) and looking through the [Swift documentation](https://www.swift.org/documentation/). In that app I am doing **tutorials** about C++ and learning more about it. For example in that app it will tell me to make the character move by calling a function. I am also watching [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuo50-TiKgo) about people using swift to make a project to better familiarize it.

### EDP
In the egineering design process I am **defining a problem and brainstorming solutions**. I wanted to do a project in which I find passion in so I had a problem which is waking up late and feeling sleepy when I wake up. So I brainstormed possible solutions for this app to solve my issues. I came up of an idea of making an annoying alarm clock to wake me up.

### Skills
Some of the skills I learned during the past 2 weeks is **how to read** and **how to learn**. For example I learned to read because I had to read the documentation about swift and had to do close reading since C++ is a new language to me. This leads me to my second skill which is how to learn I had to absorb the information I was reading. 



### What I am doing for a couple of weeks
* Continue using the Swift Playground app to learn more about C++
* Watch more videos
* Play in the Swift Playground to test code by looking at the documentation at swift website
* Figure out some features of my app
