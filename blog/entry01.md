### Introduction 
For my APCSA class we have a year long project in where we can create anything we want with any tool. For my project I will me making an alarm clock that will not stop ringing until you do a task to stop it. That way you are able to wakeup and feel awake. I will be making this project with Swift, a C++ programing language. I have so far tinkered with Swift by downloading the app Swift Playground. In that app I am doing tutorials about C++ and learning more about it. For example in that app it will tell me to make the character move by calling a function. I am also watching videos about people using swift to make a project to better familiarize it. 

### What I am doing for a couple of weeks
* Continue using the Swift Playground app to learn more about C++
* Watch more videos
* Play in the Swift Playground to test code by looking at the documentation at swift website
* Figure out some features of my app
