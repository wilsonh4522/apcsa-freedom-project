### Content
I have finished my freedom project and I need to present it in an expo where judges and students walk around to view our projects. I had to create an [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WcLzoSlNBw3K7sOqBnKdIDYQO8qcwImEORhzC7rNWtE/edit?usp=sharing) which is a short pitch where I tell the judges on what my project was about and what tool I used. Some takeaways that I had in the elevator pitch was to slow down because I didn't think that I would have enough time but by the time I was done I ***realized*** that I had a lot of time. I think mistake made me rush through my project and I think it looked bad. After presenting in the expo I had to present to my ***classmates*** and show them my project. I had to create a [slide show](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xtUswi9awPwfgaCnq3W4zNdbVcAk6IAlRmpFyb6EDe8/edit#slide=id.p) where I would hook the audience, explain my project and process, and takeaways when finishing the project. After presenting I also did the ***same mistake*** in the expo. I sort of rushed through the part where I explained more about the challenge code that I had trouble with. 

### EDP
In the engineering design process I am at the final step which is communicating the results. I have done this by presenting to judges, students, and classmates. 

### Skills
The two skills that I learned is ***communication and organization***. I learned organization because I had to organize my slides. I did this by making an outline in google doc on what I would talk about show. I learned communication because I had to communication my project to students and I learned what I can improve on
