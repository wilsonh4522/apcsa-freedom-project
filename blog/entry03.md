### Content
For my project I will be creating an alarm that will only stop when a person solves a simple math problem. I need to make my MVP (minimal viable product). I think making a alarm will be hard to I will make some kind of code that will count to a certain number in which the user wants to wake up.  

### EDP    
In the Engineering Design Process, I am planning the most promising and minimal solution. I am doing this by figuring out a way to make a counter that will count to a certain number. I also need to fugure out how to lock the user from stoping the sound and forcing them to solve the math problem. I can use this [component](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/timer) in swift but I will need to figure out how to use it.
