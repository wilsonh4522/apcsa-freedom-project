### Content
In APCSA (AP Computer Science A) we are doing a year long freedom project where we make any project we want and work on it for the entire schop; year. In this blog I will take you through my progress and my plans. For my project I will be creating an alarm that will only stop when a person solves a simple math problem so that they can feel more awake. This is a problem that I struggle with and would like to solve. For this project I need to make my MVP (minimal viable product) so that I have at least something. I think making a alarm will be hard so I might consider to make some kind of code that will count to a certain number in which the user wants to wake up, like a timer. Throughout the month I have working on my project little by little. 

### EDP    
In the Engineering Design Process, I am planning the most promising and minimal solution. I am doing this by figuring out a way to make a counter that will count to a certain number. I also need to fugure out how to lock the user from stoping the sound and forcing them to solve the math problem. I can use this [component](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/timer) in swift but I will need to figure out how to use it.
