Today I decided that I will make a timer instead of a alarm for my MVP (Minimal Viable Product) because I think it will be easier to do since when you make an alarm there are a lot of things that should be held account. I don't know how this would work on a phone because I don't know how to lock the alarm from the user from existing app and also appear on the home screen. I looked at this [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkit/setting_an_alarm).
