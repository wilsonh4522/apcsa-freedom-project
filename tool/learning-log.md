* Today I downloaded [Swift Playground](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492) in the App Store. It gave me an intorduction and tutorials on how to use Swift. It introduced me componets like functions. I also looked at the [documentation](https://www.swift.org/documentation/) on components and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3KRE-MyCO8&t=498s) of people making apps using Swift to better familiarize myself with the langaage. Some challenges I had was navigated through the app. One question I have is if Swift Playground the same as when you downlaod swift.

11/13/23:
* Today I tried using swift in replit. It was confusing to use but I read some documentation about swift in replit. 

11/26/23:
* Today I will try coding swift with replit and trying some components from the swift documentation. I tried coding time by looking at this swift [component](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dates_and_times) since I will be needing to use time for my alarm. I am still deciding if I want to do a [timer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/timer) or a fixed time. I am figuring out which is easier for my MVP (Minimal Viable Product). Since I am making an alarm so I need sound so I looked at this [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/soundanalysis/) about sound and began tinkering about it. Using replit is a bit confusing to use so I will go home and use Swift Playground. One challenge I face is that there are a lot of components of each timer and sound so I don't know which one to use.

12/4/23:
* Today I wanted to find out if I needed to download x code if I wanted to create my project. I also began looking more at what compnents I will use when making the project.

12/18/23
* Today in class I began looking at projects made from Swift. I also looked at some of the code it uses so I can better familiarize myself with it.

1/8/24
* Today in class I began to familiarize myself more with Swift. I looked more at documentation, videos, and other projects.
