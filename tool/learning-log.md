* Today I downloaded [Swift Playground](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492) in the App Store. It gave me an intorduction and tutorials on how to use Swift. It introduced me componets like functions. I also looked at the [documentation](https://www.swift.org/documentation/) on components and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3KRE-MyCO8&t=498s) of people making apps using Swift to better familiarize myself with the langaage. Some challenges I had was navigated through the app. One question I have is if Swift PLayground the same as when you downlaod swift.
